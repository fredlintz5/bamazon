<h1>Bamazon</h1>

<h3>A command line Amazon-Esque shopping program</h3>

---

Node.js & MySQL

Overview

In this project, I created an Amazon-like storefront using SequelPro, Node.js, & Inquirer. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. The app also tracks product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

The app has two different login points:

* `node bamazon.js` - for customer' to login and see available items to purchase and choose what item and how many they want. See below...

* `node bamazonManager.js` - for manager's to login and see sales history, current inventory levels, and adds the ability to add product, or update existing product. See below...
