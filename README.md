<h1>Bamazon</h1>

<h3>A command line Amazon-Esque shopping program</h3>

---

Node.js & MySQL

Overview

In this project, I created an Amazon-like storefront using SequelPro and Node.js. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. The app also tracks product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

The app has two different login points:

* `node bamazon.js` - for customer' to login and see available items to purchase and choose what item and how many they want. See below...

* `node bamazonManager.js` - for manager's to login and see sales history, current inventory levels, and adds the ability to add product, or update existing product. See below...
